Description:
Flyway is an open-source database migration tool primarily for Java applications.   
It enables developers to manage and version database schema changes effectively.   
Using SQL scripts or Java code, Flyway allows for the gradual evolution of the database schema by applying incremental changes or "migrations." 

Key features include:

* Versioning: Each migration is assigned a unique version, ensuring the order of execution.
* Rollback Capability: Allows reverting to previous versions if necessary.
* Compatibility: Works with a wide range of databases including MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and more.
* Ease of Use: Simple command-line interface and integrations with build tools like Maven and Gradle.
* Flyway helps maintain database integrity while facilitating collaboration in team environments.
